/**
 * A Step represents a step that Pottery carries out when processing the user's code.
 *
 * <p>A Step has a map of variant names to Executions for that variant. If no Execution is provided
 * for a variant, then the Execution for the "default" variant is run, if it exists. If it does not
 * exist, no Execution is run for this step.
 *
 * <p>For example, a compile Step might only have Executions specified for variants that require
 * compilation, and a validation Step might only have a default variant so that all variants are
 * validated with the same code.
